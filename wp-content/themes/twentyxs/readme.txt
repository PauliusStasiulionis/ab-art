TwentyXS is a derivation of TwentyTen, the default theme of WordPress 3.1.

== Description ==

TwentyXS is a stylish, customizable, simple and readable theme. You can easily add a custom menu, change header image and background. TwentyXS supports nine widgetized areas (two sidebars, three areas beneath the logo, four in the footer area) and featured images (thumbnails for gallery posts and custom header images for posts and pages). It includes stylesheets for print and the admin Visual Editor, special styles for posts in the "Asides" and "Gallery" categories. Since version 1.0 TwentyXS has a settings page in the admin backend to edit the theme even more easily.

The link to the TwentyXS settings page is located in the Appearance menu.

In the footer area you find a random posts box. It shows an excerpt of a randomly chosen article. Whenever you mark an article as sticky the sticky post will be displayed in the box, too. You can remove the box via TwentyXS settings page.

With the 'Back to top' link above the footer widget areas you can navigate to the head of the blog. In style.css I used some properties like box-shadow, opacity, etc. referring to CSS3.

I added some additional files:
* sidebar.php and sidebar-right.php are needed to display the two sidebars ('Left Sidebar' & 'Right Sidebar').
* editor-style.css and editor-style-rtl.css are used to style the TinyMCE editor.
* sidebar-top.php is needed for the three top widget areas ('Top Area 1a, width:50%' & 'Top Area 1b, width:50%' & 'Top Area 2, width:100%').
* sidebar-footer.php is needed for the four footer widget areas ('Footer Area 1, width:100%' & 'Footer Area 2a, width:50%' & 'Footer Area 2b, width:50%' & 'Footer Area 3, width:100%').
* scroll.js makes scrolling very cool as described on TwentyXS settings page.
* snow.js - let the snow fall on your website!
